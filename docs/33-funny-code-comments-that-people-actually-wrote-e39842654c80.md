用代码写注释是一门艺术。

开发人员使用注释来提高代码的可读性。适当的注释使你的代码更有价值。

阅读其他开发人员写的代码很无聊。开发人员有时会故意写一些有趣的评论。只是为了确保下次阅读您的代码的人可以享受一点乐趣。

编写代码从来就不是严肃的工作。它必须有点乐趣。下面是人们实际编写的有趣的代码注释列表。

1.

```
stop(); // Hammertime!
```

2.

```
// Replaces with spaces the braces in cases where braces in places //cause stasis 
   $str = str_replace(array("\{","\}")," ",$str);
```

3.

```
/**
 * Always returns true.
 */
public boolean isAvailable() {
    return false;
}// Never totally trust comments, use common sense
```

4.

```
/*
 * You may think you know what the following code does.
 * But you dont. Trust me.
 * Fiddle with it, and youll spend many a sleepless
 * night cursing the moment you thought youd be clever
 * enough to "optimize" the code below.
 * Now close this file and go play with something else.
 */
```

5.

```
int MyFunction()
{
    // There once was a man named Dave
    int Result = 0;

    // Whose code just wouldn't behave
    MyObject *Ptr = new MyObject();

    // He left to go to a meetin'
    Result = Ptr->DoSomething();

    // And left his memory a leakin'
    return Result;
}
```

6.

```
class Act //That's me!!!
{

}
```

7.

```
// I wonder if she actually reads these.
```

8.

```
// error codes
#define ERROR_SUCESS 0
#define ERROR_SUCCESS_IS_MISSPELLED 1
```

9.

```
// If this code works, it was written by Paul DiLascia. If not, I 
// don't know who wrote it
```

10.

```
using namespace std;            // So sue me
```

11.

```
// Abandon all hope ye who enter beyond this point
```

12.

/* Mark: If there's one thing you learn from this code, it is this...
   Never, ever fly Air France.  Their customer service is absolutely
   the worst.  I've never heard the words "That's not my problem" as 
   many times as I have from their staff -- It should, without doubt
   be their corporate motto if it isn't already.  Don't bother giving 
   them business because you're just a pain in their side and they
   will be sure to let you know the first time you speak to them.

   If you ever want to make me happy just tell me that you, too, will
   never fly Air France again either (in spite of their excellent
   cuisine). 

   Update by oej: The merger with KLM has transferred this
   behaviour to KLM as well. 
   Don't bother giving them business either...

   Only if you want to travel randomly without luggage, you
   might pick either of them.
